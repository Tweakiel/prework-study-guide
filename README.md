# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

The purpose of this project is to learn, practice and execute very minimal usage of HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript in order to make a study guide.
this study guide was made with the help of the prework study guide of U of T SCS Full Stack Development Bootcamp.
the reasoning for this project is to display what each of the topics that I have learned can do, even in the most simple way imaginable.

In this reposition, I learned how to use HTML to display text, images. I learned how to format my text and specifically space the text and add some color to the page using CSS. Lastly, i used JavaScript to use for loops, arrays and if statements in order to display text in the console log to prove that i have learned these topics.
